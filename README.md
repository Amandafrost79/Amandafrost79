# Hi,  I'm Amanda Frost! 👩‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a student at **Get Coding NL**, a full-time working mom, and a tech enthusiast who's navigating the thrilling world of coding.

## 🌟 About Me
Juggling between my role as a mom, a professional, and a coding student, I'm always on a quest to find tech solutions that simplify everyday life. My journey in tech began recently but has quickly grown into a passion I'm eager to explore more and more every day.

## 🚀 My Recent Project: What's in Your Cupboard?!
As a busy mom, I know the struggle of balancing work, home, and meal planning. That's why I created **"What's in Your Cupboard?!"** - a project close to my heart. Here's what makes it special:

- **Hassle-Free Meal Planning**: Designed for busy moms, it helps you whip up meals with ingredients you already have.
- **Random Recipe Generator**: Need inspiration? The generator throws in new meal ideas to keep your dinners exciting.
- **Favorites Page**: Like a recipe? Save it for future reference on your personal favorites page.
